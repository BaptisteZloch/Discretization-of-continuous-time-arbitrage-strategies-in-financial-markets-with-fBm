  abstract={Revolutions often spawn counterrevolutions and the efficient market hypothesis in finance is no exception. The intellectual dominance of the efficient-market revolution has more been challenged by economists who stress psychological and behaviorial elements of stock-price determination and by econometricians who argue that stock returns are, to a considerable extent, predictable. This survey examines the attacks on the efficient market hypothesis and the relationship between predictability and efficiency. I conclude that our stock markets are more efficient and less predictable than many recent academic papers would have us believe.},

The new algorithms, which are both accurate and efficient, allow us to generate not only a one-dimensional fBm process, but also two- and three-dimensional fBm fields.}

abstract = {Efficient methods are presented for digital simulation of a general homogeneous process (multidimensional or multivariate or multivariate-multidimensional) as a series of cosine functions with weighted amplitudes, almost evenly spaced frequencies, and random phase angles. The approach is also extended to the simulation of a general non-homogeneous oscillatory process characterized by an evolutionary power spectrum. Generalized forces involved in the modal analysis of linear or non-linear structures can be efficiently simulated as a multivariate process using the cross-spectral density matrix computed from the spectral density function of the multidimensional excitation process. Possible applications include simulation of (i) wind-induced ocean wave elevation, (ii) spatial random variation of material properties, (iii) the fluctuating part of atmospheric wind velocities and (iv) random surface roughness of highways and airport runways.}
